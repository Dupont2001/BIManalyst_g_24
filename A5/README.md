# BIManalyst group 24
# Focus Area: Structural
# Claim: The line load for beams can be calculated through cross-sectional area x material density x gravitational acceleration. 

## Our learning experience:
# Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended:
We started as a modeller and after we have gained some experience and knowledge, we have developed our knowledge and level to be an analyst. 

# What else do you still need to learn? 
We need to learn more about python, which will make the course a bit easier. 
We need also to get an overview to other focus area and their process using OpenBIM. It might help seeing the oppertunities using OpenBIM.

# How you might use OpenBIM in the future?
We can use it at every stage of our work as engineers, whether as modellers, analysts, or in any other role. OpenBIM will be essential during the design phase, the analysis process, and the evaluation stage. It can also assist in tracking time, estimating material quantities, and managing budgets.

## Our process of developing the tutorial:
# Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
The process of the course felt largely independent, as much of the work required self-direction. However, the teaching assistants provided excellent support whenever needed. While there was some initial confusion in the way certain concepts were taught, everything eventually made sense as the course progressed. This combination of independence, guidance, and gradual clarity helped us develop the skills to address and define questions that could be useful for our forthcoming master thesis. It also taught us how to navigate complexity and ambiguity, which will be invaluable in future academic work.

# Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
At the beginning, it was challenging to identify the right direction and connect our assignments with the concepts presented in the lectures. However, by the end of the course, we learned a lot from the various choices we made throughout the process. 

# Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?
The various tools provided a comprehensive overview of the different applications of OpenBIM and helped us understand its role in professional practice. However, it was somewhat challenging to apply these tools effectively within the constraints of a short-term course, where we were required to deliver 5 finished assignments within our focus area. We would have preferred to dive deeper into a selected few tools while still gaining an overview of the others.

# Did the tool address the use case you identified?
Yes, the tool effectively addressed the use case we identified by providing accurate data analysis, which was essential for the task. 

# Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
 Member 1: I am unlikely to use OpenBIM tools in my thesis, as I find them a bit confusing to work with. While they seem powerful in theory, the complexity makes it challenging for me to apply them effectively in an academic context.
 Member 2: Yes, I am likely to use OpenBIM tools in my thesis. Despite finding them somewhat challenging to use, I see their potential in improving collaboration and data management. With more practice, I believe they could add significant value to my research.
 Member 3: Likely. While they seem useful, I find them a bit complex, so it depends on whether I can gain more confidence in using them.

# Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
 Member 1: It is unlikely that I will use OpenBIM tools in my professional life in the next 10 years. Their complexity and the learning curve have been a barrier for me, and I currently feel more comfortable using alternative methods or tools that are easier to navigate.
 Member 2: As the industry increasingly adopts these tools, I see their importance in ensuring effective workflows and better project outcomes. While they can be complex, I think investing time to master them will be beneficial in the long run. So likely yes. 
 Member 3: Maybe. If the tools become easier to use or more standard in the industry, I might consider using them.

 # Wrap up: 
This series of exercises, spanning from A1 to A5, which collectively aimed to explore and expand the application of OpenBIM principles through BlenderBIM scripting. Each task progressively built upon the previous one, introducing more complex functionalities and deeper insights into the use of IFC models for solving real-world problems in architecture, engineering, and construction.

 This journey through A1 to A5 demonstrates how BlenderBIM can be leveraged not only as a modeling tool but also as a powerful platform for OpenBIM-based data management and scripting. By mastering these tasks, users have gained a robust foundation for integrating scripting into their workflows, enabling efficient data handling, improved project coordination, and enhanced sustainability in building design.
