# BIManalyst group 24
# Focus Area: Structural
# Claim: The line load for beams can be calculated through cross-sectional area x material density x gravitational acceleration. 

## Our learning experience:
# Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended:
We started as modeller and now after we gained som experince and knowledge, we devalop our knowledge and level to be analyst. 

# What else do you still need to learn? 
We need to learn more about python, which will make the course a bit easier. 
We need also to get an overview to other focus area and their process using OpenBIM. It might help seeing the oppertunites using OpenBIM.


# How you might use OpenBIM in the future?
We can use it at every stage of our work as engineers, whether as modelers, analysts, or in any other role. OpenBIM will be essential during the design phase, the analysis process, and the evaluation stage. It can also assist in tracking time, estimating material quantities, and managing budgets.

## Our process of developing the tutorial:
# Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?

# Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
At the beginning, it was challenging to identify the right direction and connect our assignments with the concepts presented in the lectures. However, by the end of the course, we learned a lot from the various choices we made throughout the process. That said, we felt there was a lack of sufficient introduction and guidance for the different problems and assignments that we faced.


# Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?
The various tools provided a comprehensive overview of the different applications of OpenBIM and helped us understand its role in professional practice. However, it was somewhat challenging to apply these tools effectively within the constraints of a short-term course, where we were required to deliver a finished assignment in our focus area. We would have preferred to dive deeper into a select few tools while still gaining an overview of the others.
