# BIManalyst group 24
# Focus Area: Structural
# Claim: The surface load for the hollow core slabs is 3.06 kN/m^2
# Report and page number: CES_BLD_24_06_STR Page 11 Table 7
# Brief description: The script takes the dimensions and densities from the property sets and uses them to calculate the surface load for the slabs

#Introduktion: 
#The selected OpenBIM role focuses on the automation of beam load calculations, designed to demonstrate how to work with BlenderBIM scripting for structural analysis. This introductory script showcases how to filter specific beams based on naming conventions, retrieve key properties like dimensions and material density, and calculate the self-weight load for each beam. It further groups beams with identical properties, providing a summary for easy comparison.

#The purpose of this OpenBIM task is to show how BlenderBIM can be used to fill in missing data or perform custom analyses, making it useful for both newcomers and experienced users. By using scripting, the self-weight of beams is calculated accurately and saved, allowing for detailed documentation or further analysis.

#This focus on structural load calculations is relevant for engineers and designers aiming to ensure the safety and efficiency of building structures. Proper load calculations contribute to the structural integrity of a building, ensuring that it can withstand applied forces while remaining energy-efficient. Additionally, accurate load calculations help building owners and stakeholders make informed decisions on materials and design, potentially lowering material costs and enhancing sustainability through optimized structural design.
