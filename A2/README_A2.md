# BIManalyst group 24
# Focus Area: Structural
# Claim: The line load for the DR22-250 is 1.296 kN/m
# Report and page number: CES_BLD_24_06_STR Page 11 Table 7
# Brief description: The script takes the dimensions and densities from the property sets and uses them to calculate the line load for the chosen beam type

# A2a: 
#The sum of our score for our group is 3 out of 12. We are 3 in our group, and one choose 0-strongly disagree, one choose 1-disagree and the last one choose 2-neutral. 
# We are an analyst group. 

# A2b: 
# We are working with bulding #2406 and focusing on structural area. 
# The claim is "to extract data from the project and calculate the line load for the DR22-250 beams"
# The script takes the dimensions and densities from the property sets and uses them to calculate the line load for the beam type
# It is importent to check if the beams can hold the self weight and load from other properties. and compare it with analytical numbers.
