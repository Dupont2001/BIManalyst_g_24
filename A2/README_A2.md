# BIManalyst group 24
# Focus Area: Structural
# Claim: The surface load for the hollow core slabs is 3.06 kN/m^2
# Report and page number: CES_BLD_24_06_STR Page 11 Table 7
# Brief description: The script takes the dimensions and densities from the property sets and uses them to calculate the surface load for the slabs

# A2a: 
#The sum of our score for our group is 3 out of 12. We are 3 in our group, and onr choose 0-strongly disagree, one shose 1-disagree nad the last one shose 2-netural. 
# We are an analyst group. 

# A2b: 
# We are working eith bulding #2406 and focusing on structural area. 
# The calim is "to extract data from the project and calculate the surface load for the hollow core slabs is 3.06 kN/m^2"
# The script takes the dimensions and densities from the property sets and uses them to calculate the surface load for the slabs
# It is importent to chek if the slabs can hold the self wreight and load from other properties. and compare it with analytical numbers.
